## Theta's Guide to making tags!

#### What's a tag?
A tag is the text that appears above your name, You can use this system to make some really cool stuff!

#### Basic Tag.

File Template:<br>
```
(File Name: Your FriendCode#1234)

type:static
code:friendcode#1234
color:#E9D7FF
text:This is a Basic Tag!
```
Step 1.
> Navigate to your `AmongUs\Chaos` folder and make a new txt file with the same name as your AU Friend Code (Example: stormydot#5793) <br> 

Step 2.
> Open the file you've just created. Inside of it paste the File Template provided above (excluding the "File Name" part.)<br>

Step 3.
> You'll need the following information: [Hex Code](https://htmlcolorcodes.com/color-picker/) (Example: #E9D7FF). Tag Text (Example:This is a Basic Tag!)<br>

Once all that information is filled out, go to your Among Us and create a new lobby, and your tag should show up!<br>

#### __Advanced Tag.__
File Template:<br>
```
(File Name: FriendCode#1234)

type:sforce
code:friendcode#1234
toptext:<color=#E9D7FF>This</color> <color=#9974a0>is</color> 
name :<color=#9974a0>an</color> <color=#E9D7FF>Advanced Tag!</color>
```
The difference between a basic tag and an advanced tag is the amount of customization you can do. Basic (aka Static) tags are limited to a single color, however Advanced (aka sforce) are not limited with color amount. <br>

Step 1.
> Navigate to your `AmongUs\Chaos` folder and rename the `NEW-TAG.txt` file with the same name as your AU Friend Code (Example: stormydot#5793) <br>


Step 2.
> Open the file you've just renamed. Inside of it there should already be text, let me explain what this is.<br>

> `toptext` is basically just the basic tag with the ability for multiple colors to be used. As an example, the template provided would change the color for `"This"` and `"is"` separately. <br>

> `name` is where stuff gets interesting, you can change your name to whatever text is provided here, and also the color of it too. As an example, the template provided would change the color of `"An"` and `"Advanced tag"` separately. <br>


Step 3.
> Add your Friend Code to `"code:"`,  change the toptext to what you'd like,
